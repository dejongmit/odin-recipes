    <h2>Jambalaya Light</h2>
    <p>I think of this Cajun Sausage and Rice Skillet has similar flavors and ingredients as jambalaya, but it's a slightly scaled back, simplified version, 
        perfect for quick weeknight dinner. And the best part? The leftovers are SO GOOD. So feel free to add this tasty skillet to your meal prep rotation!</p>

        <li>1 15oz. can fire roasted diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup long grain white rice</li>
        <li>1.5 cups chicken broth (can sub with equivalent of bullion + water)</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure out all spices into a small cup and mix them together</li>
        <li>Slice the sausage into 1/4-1/2 inch thick slices. Add the sausage and cooking oil to a deep skillet or Dutch oven and sauté over medium heat until the sausage is well browned.</li>
        <li>While the sausage is cooking, dice the bell pepper. Once the sausage is browned, add the bell pepper to the skillet and continue to sauté for about one more minute.</li>
        <li> Add the spice mixture and rice to the skillet with the sausage and bell pepper and continue to sauté for one minute more to toast the spices/rice.</li>
        <li>Add the fire roasted diced tomatoes (with juices), and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir to combine and dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet.</li>
        <li>Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the broth to come to a full boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let the skillet simmer for 5 minute intervals, stirring each time, until the rice is cooked through.</li>
